# Scene Initialization for Autonomous Driving (T-IV Submission)

This repository hosts the **project page** for our IEEE *Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles* (T-IV) submission on **scene initialization** for autonomous driving simulation.

> **Note**: The paper PDF, BibTeX, acknowledgements, and contact information will be added after acceptance.

---

## Overview

We study **data-driven initial scene generation** conditioned on vectorized HD maps, focusing on:
- **Realism** of joint agent configurations (distributional similarity)
- **Safety** of generated initial scenes (vehicle-level safety rates)
- **Diversity** of generated scenes (variety in agent counts, positions, and interaction patterns)

This project page primarily provides **qualitative results (GIFs)** and a concise summary of the method and findings.

## Qualitative Results (GIFs)

We will provide a large collection of qualitative samples as GIFs.

### Gallery (placeholder)
- `assets/gifs/` will contain the main qualitative results.
- Each GIF should be accompanied by a short caption (scenario type, dataset, notes).

Example structure:
- `assets/gifs/nuplan/`
- `assets/gifs/womd/`
- `assets/gifs/hwaseong/` (unseen map)

---

## Quantitative Comparison (placeholder)

We plan to include main comparison tables summarizing distribution similarity (e.g., JSD-based metrics) and safety rates.

- Figure/table file: `assets/figs/comparison.png` (placeholder)

---

## Paper (TBD)

- **Paper PDF**: to be uploaded after acceptance
- **BibTeX**: to be added after acceptance

---

## Acknowledgements & Contact (TBD)

After acceptance, we will add:
- Acknowledgements
- Contact information
